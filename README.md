# Language Translation using Transformer Models

This project focuses on language translation using state-of-the-art transformer models, specifically leveraging the Helsinki-NLP Opus-MT model for English to Hindi translation.

## Project Overview

- **Data Preparation**: The project utilizes the IITB English-Hindi dataset for training and evaluation. This dataset contains parallel English and Hindi sentences.

- **Model Selection**: The project employs the Helsinki-NLP Opus-MT model, a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model fine-tuned for translation tasks.

- **Tokenization**: AutoTokenizer from the Transformers library is used to tokenize the input text for the translation model.

- **Model Training and Evaluation**: The Opus-MT model is trained on the English-Hindi dataset and evaluated on separate validation and test sets to assess translation quality.

- **Inference**: After training, the model is used for inference to translate English sentences into Hindi.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Load the IITB English-Hindi dataset using the `load_dataset` function from the Datasets library.
4. Choose the appropriate transformer model for translation (e.g., Helsinki-NLP Opus-MT).
5. Tokenize the input text using the chosen tokenizer.
6. Train the translation model using the prepared dataset.
7. Evaluate the trained model on validation and test sets to measure translation performance.
8. Use the trained model for inference by providing English sentences as input and obtaining translated Hindi sentences as output.
